before the setup function I coded x, y, speedX, and speedY
After the set up function I stated angleMode(DEGREES) to be able to work in degrees
on lines 9 - 12 I defined X, Y, and speedX and speedY
I created a function for my sprite outside of the draw function 
called myCatcher to draw and then created four if statements
