before the setup function I coded x, y, speedX, and speedY
After the set up function I stated angleMode(DEGREES) to be able to work in degrees
on lines 9 - 12 I defined X, Y, and speedX and speedY
I created a function for my sprite outside of the draw function 
called myCatcher to draw and then created four if statements

Then created a function for keyPressed
left arrow coded for speedX
right arrow coded for speedX
up arrow and down arrow are coded for speedY
once either of those keys are pressed the sprite changes direction
